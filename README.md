Java API for tensorflow is deprecated.
Android API for tensorflow exists but we can't use that here.

Two Java APIs that I am using:
    1) Javacpp presets. (Just a way of calling c++ code from java) (C++ Interface of Tensorflow)
    2) Nd4j (Deep learning framework. It has a frontend for tensorflow)
